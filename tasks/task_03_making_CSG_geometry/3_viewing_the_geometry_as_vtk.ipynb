    "It is also possible to create a 3D representation of CSG geometry. The model is converted into a pixelated geometry which can resemble the style of geometry seen in the minecraft computer game.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not an actual representation of the CSG geometry but more like a sample of the types of cells with 3D coordinates. CAD geometry is covered later and this gives us a method of seeing the 3D geometry more accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "3D pixelated geometry can still be useful for exploring the model; particularly if the resolution is high enough. However, this can be a memory intensive task.\n",
