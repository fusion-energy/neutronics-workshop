## Task 3 - CSG geometry

Please allow 25 minutes for this task.

Expected outputs from this task are also in the [presentation](https://slides.com/openmc_workshop/neutronics_workshop#/4).

In this task you will use OpenMC to construct and view simple geometries, and assign materials to geometry cells.

**Learning Outcomes**

- Using OpenMC to construct simple Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) geometry.
- Visualisation of models using 2D slices and 3D cube geometry.
