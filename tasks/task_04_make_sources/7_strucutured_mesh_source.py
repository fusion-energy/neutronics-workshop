# this example shows users how to make a mesh source using a cylindrical mesh and a source term for each voxel.

# this is a minimal example but a more realistic example could use the voxel location to look up properties
# of the plasma at each coordinate and customize the source energy and strength at each mesh voxel location

# MeshSpatial each mesh element has the same source with potentially a different
# strength while in MeshSource the elements can have a different source.
# Having a different source would allow a different energy distribution and therefore
# MeshSources are useful for shut down dose rate simulations where each active element
# results in a different photon emission
