## Task 0 - Monte Carlo Methods

This task is a simple introductino to Monte Carlo methods. 

In this task you investigate the use of simple Monte Carlo methods to estimate the mathematical constant $\pi$, then exploring how multiple events proporgate in a simple neutron transport simulation, and how small changes to key parameters has a large effect on the path of the particle, as well as how small variances propagate to large differences between particles over the entire lifetime. 


**Learning Outomces** 

- Understand how the fundamental principles of Monte Carlo simulation methods 
- Higher statistics greatly improve the accuracy of simulations
- Small variations in neutron interaction outcomes, propagate over larger numbers of interactions 
- Small variance in interaction probabilities propagate to significant difference over the lifetime of a particle.
