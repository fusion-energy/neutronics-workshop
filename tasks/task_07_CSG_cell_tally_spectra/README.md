## Task 7 - Finding neutron and photon spectra using cell tallies

Please allow 15 minutes for this task.

Expected outputs from this task are also in the [presentation](https://slides.com/openmc_workshop/neutronics_workshop#/8).

In this task you will use OpenMC to tally neutron and photon spectra on different surfaces and cells in a geometry.

**Learning Outcomes**

- Plotting neutron / photon spectra for cells and surfaces and observing the changing neutron energy at different locations in the reactor.
- Performing coupled neutron photon simulations where photons are created from neutron interactions.
