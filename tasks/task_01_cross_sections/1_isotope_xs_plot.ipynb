    "\n",
    "Knowing the interaction probabilities of isotopes and materials in your model can help you understand simulation results. There are several online tools for plotting nuclear cross sections such as [www.xsplot.com](http://xsplot.com), however, OpenMC can also plot cross sections.\n",

    "This python notebook allows users to plot neutron interaction cross sections for specific isotopes using OpenMC.\n",

    "In this first part of the task we are plotting the <b>microscopic</b> cross-section \"<b>σ</b>\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Microscopic cross section is the effective target area in $\\mathrm{m}^2$ presented by a single nucleus to an incident neutron beam.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is used to characterize the probability of reaction between a neutron and an individual nucleus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Microscopic is often stated in units of barns where 1 barn is equal to $10^{−28}$ $\\mathrm{m}^2$ "
