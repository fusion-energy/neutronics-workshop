    "As we have seen in Parts 1 and 2, materials can be defined in OpenMC using isotopes and elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with this is that to construct some materials the user would be required to input many lines of code. As a result, there is opportunity for errors and the code becomes harder to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wouldn't it be great if someone had made a nice collection of the material definitions used in fusion neutronics that could simply be used without having to remember all of the isotopes or elements that go into each one? It would be even better if the density was automatically adjusted to account for isotopic enrichment, temperature and pressure effects.\n",
